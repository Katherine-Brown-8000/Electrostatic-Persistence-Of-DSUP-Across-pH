## Calculating PI or eletrostatic potential

The protein sequence used for DSUP comes from the NIH
[damage suppressor [Ramazzottius varieornatus]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/BAV59442.1)

## DSUP electrostatic potential diagram
![Alt](https://github.com/Katherine-Brown-8000/DSUP-acidic-config/blob/main/Figure_2A_to_2F_Labled.png)
This figure was generated using ChimeraX from the DSUP files for pH 5.5, 7.4 and 11.5
All the files used to generate these images have been shared in the file ()
- A) is DSUP at pH 5.5 (Acidic conditions)
- B) is DSUP at pH 7.4 (Physiologically neutral conditions)
- C) is DSUP at pH 11.5 (Basic conditions)
- D) is the base structure of DSUP generated by AlphaFold3
- E) is DSUP at all three difference pHs overlapped
- F) is DSUP at Physiological pH 7.4 with overlap of the isoelectric point 9.76

  ### Intructions for Generating the DSUP diagram depicted above

 - 1 Use AlphaFold3 to generate a fold prediction for the DSUP protein sequence. This produces a CIF structure file (fold_analysis_dsup_model_1.cif).
 - 2 Open the CIF file in ChimeraX and export it as a PDB format file named (dsup_model_0.pdb).
 - 3 Upload the PDB file(dsup_model_0.pdb) to the PDB2PQR Server to generate .pqr and .in files at pH 5.5, 7.4, and 11.5.
 - 4 Run the .pqr and .in files through APBS to compute electrostatic potential maps (.dx files).
 - 5 Load both the .pqr and .dx files into ChimeraX to visualize and export electrostatic surfaces for each pH condition.
 - 6 All figure generated in ChimeraX were then open in GIMP for side by side comparisons and labeling.
